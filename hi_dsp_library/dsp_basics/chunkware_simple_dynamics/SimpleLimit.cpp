		 * sample in a look-ahead buffer would be the highest peak. As such,
		 * instead of storing all samples in a look-ahead buffer, it only stores
		 * the max peak, and compares all incoming samples to that one.
		 * The max peak has a hold time equal to what the look-ahead buffer
		 * would have been, which is tracked by a timer (counter). When this
		 * timer expires, the sample would have exited from the buffer. Therefore,
		 * a new sample must be assigned to the max peak. We assume that the next
		 * highest sample in our theoretical buffer is the current input sample.
		 * In reality, we know this is probably NOT the case, and that there has
		 * been another sample, slightly lower than the one before it, that has
		 * passed the input. If we do not account for this possibility, our gain
		 * reduction could be insufficient, resulting in an "over" at the output.
		 * To remedy this, we simply apply a suitably long release stage in the
		 * envelope follower.

		/* REGARDING THE ATTACK: This limiter achieves "look-ahead" detection
		 * by allowing the envelope follower to attack the max peak, which is
		 * held for the duration of the attack phase -- unless a new, higher
		 * peak is detected. The output signal is buffered so that the gain
		 * reduction is applied in advance of the "offending" sample.
		 */

		 /* NOTE: a DC offset is not necessary for the envelope follower,
		  * as neither the max peak nor envelope should fall below the
		  * threshold (which is assumed to be around 1.0 linear).

		/* REGARDING THE GAIN REDUCTION: Due to the logarithmic nature
		 * of the attack phase, the sidechain will never achieve "full"
		 * attack. (Actually, it is only guaranteed to achieve 99% of
		 * the input value over the given time constant.) As such, the
		 * limiter cannot achieve "brick-wall" limiting. There are 2
		 * workarounds:
		 *
		 * 1) Set the threshold slightly lower than the desired threshold.
		 *		i.e. 0.0dB -> -0.1dB or even -0.5dB
		 *
		 * 2) Clip the output at the threshold, as such:
		 *
		 *		if ( in1 > thresh_ )		in1 = thresh_;
		 *		else if ( in1 < -thresh_ )	in1 = -thresh_;
		 *
		 *		if ( in2 > thresh_ )		in2 = thresh_;
		 *		else if ( in2 < -thresh_ )	in2 = -thresh_;
		 *
		 *		(... or replace with your favorite branchless clipper ...)
