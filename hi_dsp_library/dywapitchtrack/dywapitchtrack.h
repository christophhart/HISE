 The dywapitchtrack library computes the pitch of an audio stream in real time.
 
 The pitch is the main frequency of the waveform (the 'note' being played or sung).
 It is expressed as a float in Hz.
 
 Unlike the human ear, pitch detection is difficult to achieve for computers. Many
 algorithms have been designed and experimented, but there is no 'best' algorithm.
 They all depend on the context and the tradeoffs acceptable in terms of speed and
 latency. The context includes the quality and 'cleanness' of the audio : obviously
 polyphonic sounds (multiple instruments playing different notes at the same time)
 are extremely difficult to track, percussive or noisy audio has no pitch, most
 real-life audio have some noisy moments, some instruments have a lot of harmonics,
 etc...
 
 The dywapitchtrack is based on a custom-tailored algorithm which is of very high quality:
 both very accurate (precision < 0.05 semitones), very low latency (< 23 ms) and
 very low error rate. It has been  thoroughly tested on human voice.
 
 It can best be described as a dynamic wavelet algorithm (dywa):
 
 The heart of the algorithm is a very powerful wavelet algorithm, described in a paper
 by Eric Larson and Ross Maddox : "Real-Time Time-Domain Pitch Tracking Using Wavelets"
 http://online.physics.uiuc.edu/courses/phys498pom/NSF_REU_Reports/2005_reu/Real-Time_Time-Domain_Pitch_Tracking_Using_Wavelets.pdf
 
 This central algorithm has been improved by adding dynamic tracking, to reduce the
 common problems of frequency-halving and voiced/unvoiced errors. This dynamic tracking
 explains the need for a tracking structure (dywapitchtracker). The dynamic tracking assumes
 that the main function dywapitch_computepitch is called repeatedly, as it follows the pitch
 over time and makes assumptions about human voice capabilities and reallife conditions
 (as documented inside the code).
 
 Note : The algorithm currently assumes a 44100Hz audio sampling rate. If you use a different
 samplerate, you can just multiply the resulting pitch by the ratio between your samplerate and 44100.

/* Usage

 // Allocate your audio buffers and start the audio stream.
 // Allocate a 'dywapitchtracker' structure.
 // Start the pitch tracking by calling 'dywapitch_inittracking'.
 dywapitchtracker pitchtracker;
 dywapitch_inittracking(&pitchtracker);
 
 // For each available audio buffer, call 'dywapitch_computepitch'
 double thepitch = dywapitch_computepitch(&pitchtracker, samples, start, count);
