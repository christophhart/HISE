/**
* AudioFFT provides real-to-complex/complex-to-real FFT routines.
*
* Features:
*
* - Real-complex FFT and complex-real inverse FFT for power-of-2-sized real data.
*
* - Uniform interface to different FFT implementations (currently Ooura, FFTW3 and Apple Accelerate).
*
* - Complex data is handled in "split-complex" format, i.e. there are separate
*   arrays for the real and imaginary parts which can be useful for SIMD optimizations
*   (split-complex arrays have to be of length (size/2+1) representing bins from DC
*   to Nyquist frequency).
*
* - Output is "ready to use" (all scaling etc. is already handled internally).
*
* - No allocations/deallocations after the initialization which makes it usable
*   for real-time audio applications (that's what I wrote it for and using it).
*
*
* How to use it in your project:
*
* - Add the .h and .cpp file to your project - that's all.
*
* - To get extra speed, you can link FFTW3 to your project and define
*   AUDIOFFT_FFTW3 (however, please check whether your project suits the
*   according license).
*
* - To get the best speed on Apple platforms, you can link the Apple
*   Accelerate framework to your project and define
*   AUDIOFFT_APPLE_ACCELERATE  (however, please check whether your
*   project suits the according license).
*
*
* Remarks:
*
* - AudioFFT is not intended to be the fastest FFT, but to be a fast-enough
*   FFT suitable for most audio applications.
*
* - AudioFFT uses the quite liberal MIT license.
*
*
* Example usage:
* @code
* #include "AudioFFT.h"
*
* void Example()
* {
*   const size_t fftSize = 1024; // Needs to be power of 2!
*
*   std::vector<float> input(fftSize, 0.0f);
*   std::vector<float> re(audiofft::AudioFFT::ComplexSize(fftSize));
*   std::vector<float> im(audiofft::AudioFFT::ComplexSize(fftSize));
*   std::vector<float> output(fftSize);
*
*   audiofft::AudioFFT fft;
*   fft.init(1024);
*   fft.fft(input.data(), re.data(), im.data());
*   fft.ifft(output.data(), re.data(), im.data());
* }
* @endcode
