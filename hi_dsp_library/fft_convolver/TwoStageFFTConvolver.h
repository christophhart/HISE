/**
* @class TwoStageFFTConvolver
* @brief FFT convolver using two different block sizes
*
* The 2-stage convolver consists internally of two convolvers:
*
* - A head convolver, which processes the only the begin of the impulse response.
*
* - A tail convolver, which processes the rest and major amount of the impulse response.
*
* Using a short block size for the head convolver and a long block size for
* the tail convolver results in much less CPU usage, while keeping the
* calculation time of each processing call short.
*
* Furthermore, this convolver class provides virtual methods which provide the
* possibility to move the tail convolution into the background (e.g. by using
* multithreading, see startBackgroundProcessing()/waitForBackgroundProcessing()).
*
* As well as the basic FFTConvolver class, the 2-stage convolver is suitable
* for real-time processing which means that no "unpredictable" operations like
* allocations, locking, API calls, etc. are performed during processing (all
* necessary allocations and preparations take place during initialization).
