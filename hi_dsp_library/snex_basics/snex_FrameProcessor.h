/** A simple helper class that provides interleaved iteration over a multichannel signal.
    @ingroup snex_helpers

	Some processing algorithms require interleaved processing so that you have all samples 
	for all channels available. 

	The most simple example would be a MS-Decoder

	
	@code
	// Mid-Side processing

	float m = (l + r) * 0.5f;
	float s = (l - r) * 0.5f;

	l = m + stereo_amount * s;
	r = m - stereo_amount * s;
	@endcode

	In scriptnode / SNEX, the signal data is not interleaved by default, which means that the data
	for each channel is stored consecutively in memory. This has the advantage that most operations
	that do not require frame processing can use SIMD operations. 

	However if your algorithm requires frame based processing, you can use this class which tucks
	away most of the interleaving boilerplate code.

	
	@code
	// This is the callback function required by SNEX / scriptnode
	void process(ProcessData<2>& data)
	{
		// Create a FrameProcessor object from the data
		auto frame = data.toFrameData();

		// Iterate through the frames and call the other function below
		while(frame.next())
			processFrame(frame);
	}

	// This callback will be called whenever the processing environment
	// is using frame-based processing
	void processFrame(span<float, 2>& frame)
	{
		auto& l = frame[0];
		auto& r = frame[1];

		float m = (l + r) * 0.5f;
		float s = (l - r) * 0.5f;

		l = m + stereo_amount * s;
		r = m - stereo_amount * s;
	}
	@endcode

	Since the function will be most likely inlined by the compiler, there is no performance overhead,
	and you don't need to implement the algorithm twice for compatibility with frame-based calls.

	> Note the implicit cast to the span type in the function call.

/** This data structure is useful if you're writing any kind of oscillator.

	It contains the buffer that the signal is supposed to be added to as well

	It has an overloaded ++-operator that will bump up the uptime.

    If you create an oscillator using the `snex_osc` node, this will take in the
    two parameters Frequency and FreqRatio into account and calculates a
    per sample counter that can be used to generate any kind of signal. If you
    eg. want to generate a (naive) saw waveform, all you have to do is
 
    @code
    void process(OscProcessData& d)
