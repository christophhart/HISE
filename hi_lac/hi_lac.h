/* TODO 24bit rewrite:

- write unit tests for all new functions
- make the temporary voice buffer a floating point buffer and normalize when copying from the two read buffers there.
- ensure 100% backwards compatibility
- check that there's no performance overhead if not used
- skip this when the sample material is already 16bit (maybe even add a warning then)
- support seeking and odd sample offsets
- make the .hr1 files 24bit FLACs
- add some nice end user options


SampleMap bugs:

- saving without saving the samplemap discard changes...
