             * sample in a look-ahead buffer would be the highest peak. As such,
             * instead of storing all samples in a look-ahead buffer, it only stores
             * the max peak, and compares all incoming samples to that one.
             * The max peak has a hold time equal to what the look-ahead buffer
             * would have been, which is tracked by a timer (counter). When this
             * timer expires, the sample would have exited from the buffer. Therefore,
             * a new sample must be assigned to the max peak. We assume that the next
             * highest sample in our theoretical buffer is the current input sample.
             * In reality, we know this is probably NOT the case, and that there has
             * been another sample, slightly lower than the one before it, that has
             * passed the input. If we do not account for this possibility, our gain
             * reduction could be insufficient, resulting in an "over" at the output.
             * To remedy this, we simply apply a suitably long release stage in the
             * envelope follower.

             *
             * 2) Clip the output at the threshold, as such:
             *
             *		if ( in1 > thresh_ )		in1 = thresh_;
             *		else if ( in1 < -thresh_ )	in1 = -thresh_;
