/** This is the amount of channels that your FX plugin will process.
	This might be different from the amount of total channels that is automatically calculated
	from the master container's routing matrix and stored into HISE_NUM_PLUGIN_CHANNELS (because
	this might affect existing projects).

	So if you want to use a FX with more than one stereo input, you need to define

	```
	HISE_NUM_FX_PLUGIN_CHANNELS=X
	```

	in your ExtraDefinitions. Be aware that this number must be greater or equal than the actual
	channel count of the master container's routing matrix (which will still be stored into 
	HISE_NUM_PLUGIN_CHANNELS). This still lets you use "hidden" internal stereo pairs by choosing
	a number that is smaller than the routing matrix, so if you eg. want a 6 channel plugin but
	use an additional stereo pair for internal processing, you can set the routing matrix to use
	8 channels, set HISE_NUM_FX_PLUGIN_CHANNELS to 6 and use the last stereo pair for the internal
	processing while the plugin only shows the first 6 in the DAW.
