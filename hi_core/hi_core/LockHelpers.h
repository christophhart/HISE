	that you can't acquire a lock with lower priority while holding a lock
	with higher priority on the same thread. This prevents priority inversion
	and deadlocks.

	You can of course acquire multiple locks in the correct order. In order
	to use this correctly, always use a SafeLock object instead of a standard
	ScopedLock.

	An exception is the MessageLock. If you're not on the message thread, you
	should lock the message lock for the shortest time possible. So whenever
	you try to obtain another lock on a different thread than the message thread
	while holding the message lock, it will throw a BadLockException.

	Another thing to know is that the internal priority of the IteratorLock and
	the SampleLock is equal, which means you can't acquire one of those while
	holding the other (there's no situation where you need both of those locks).
