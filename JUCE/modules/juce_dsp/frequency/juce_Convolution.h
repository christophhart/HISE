/**
    Performs stereo partitioned convolution of an input signal with an
    impulse response in the frequency domain, using the JUCE FFT class.

    This class provides some thread-safe functions to load impulse responses
    from audio files or memory on-the-fly without noticeable artefacts,
    performing resampling and trimming if necessary.

    The processing performed by this class is equivalent to the time domain
    convolution done in the FIRFilter class, with a FIRFilter::Coefficients
    object having the samples of the impulse response as its coefficients.
    However, in general it is more efficient to do frequency domain
    convolution when the size of the impulse response is 64 samples or
    greater.

    Note: The default operation of this class uses zero latency and a uniform
    partitioned algorithm. If the impulse response size is large, or if the
    algorithm is too CPU intensive, it is possible to use either a fixed
    latency version of the algorithm, or a simple non-uniform partitioned
    convolution algorithm.

    Threading: It is not safe to interleave calls to the methods of this
    class. If you need to load new impulse responses during processing the
    `load` calls must be synchronised with `process` calls, which in practice
    means making the `load` call from the audio thread. The
    `loadImpulseResponse` functions *are* wait-free and are therefore
    suitable for use in a realtime context.
