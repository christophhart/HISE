/**
    An AudioIODeviceCallback object which streams audio through an AudioProcessor.

    To use one of these, just make it the callback used by your AudioIODevice, and
    give it a processor to use by calling setProcessor().

    It's also a MidiInputCallback, so you can connect it to both an audio and midi
    input to send both streams through the processor. To set a MidiOutput for the processor,
    use the setMidiOutput() method.
