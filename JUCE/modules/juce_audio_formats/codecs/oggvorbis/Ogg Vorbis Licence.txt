=====================================================================

Ogg-Vorbis is incorporated directly into the JUCE codebase because it makes
things much easier than having to make all your builds link correctly to
the appropriate libraries on every different platform.

There are minimal changes to the Ogg-Vorbis code - a few include paths have
been changed to make it build smoothly, and some headers have been added to
allow you to exclude it from the build. Any significant code modifications
are marked clearly by "JUCE CHANGE STARTS HERE" and "JUCE_CHANGE_ENDS_HERE"
comments.

=====================================================================

The following license is the BSD-style license that comes with the Ogg-Vorbis
distribution, and which applies just to the header files included in this
directory. For more info, and to get the rest of the distribution, visit the
Ogg-Vorbis homepage: https://xiph.org/vorbis
