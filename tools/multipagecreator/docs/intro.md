The [Multipage Dialog](/ui-components/plugin-components/multipagedialog) component provides a comprehensive set of tools to develop complex dialogs. The available elements are divided into three primary categories: UI Elements, Actions, and Layout.

You can use them either in the multipagecreator app in a graphical editor, or build them up programmatically using the Scripting API to the [ScriptMultipageDialog](/scripting/scripting-api/scriptmultipagedialog).

This document contains a autogenerated list of all available elements and properties. 

> Note for using it through the scripting API: If the property supplies any **Options**, the value must be one of the listed strings, otherwise it will require either a bool value or a string.
