The elements in this category will perform an action when triggered. There are two subtypes of actions:

1. Synchronous actions which do not take a long time and are executed immediately (like writing a short text file to disk)
2. Asynchronous actions which will perform a heavyweight operation and are deferred to a background thread which are then executed in a queue.
