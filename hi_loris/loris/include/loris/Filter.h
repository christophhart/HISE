//  class Filter
//
//! Filter is an Direct Form II realization of a filter specified
//! by its difference equation coefficients and (optionally) gain,  
//! applied to the filter output (defaults to 1.). Coefficients are
//! specified and stored in order of increasing delay.
//!
//! Implements the rational transfer function
//!
//!                               -1               -nb
//!                   b[0] + b[1]z  + ... + b[nb] z
//!         Y(z) = G ---------------------------------- X(z)
//!                               -1               -na
//!                   a[0] + a[1]z  + ... + a[na] z
//!
//! where b[k] are the feed forward coefficients, and a[k] are the feedback 
//! coefficients. If a[0] is not 1, then both a and b are normalized by a[0].
//! G is the additional filter gain, and is unity if unspecified.
//!
//!
//! Filter is implemented using a std::deque to store the filter state, 
//! and relies on the efficiency of that class. If deque is not implemented
//! using some sort of circular buffer (as it should be -- deque is guaranteed
//! to be efficient for repeated insertion and removal at both ends), then
//! this filter class will be slow.
